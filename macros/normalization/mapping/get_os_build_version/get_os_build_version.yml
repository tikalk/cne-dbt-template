  - name: get_os_build_version
    description: |
      This macro extracts the build version of an operating system based on the distribution and version string.
      - For Windows distributions, it extracts the build version from the `os_version` string using a regular expression that matches Windows build formats.
      - For macOS distributions, it extracts the build version using a regular expression designed for macOS version formats.
      - For Linux distributions (Ubuntu, CentOS, SLES, Fedora, RHEL, Debian), it extracts the version from the `os_version` string using a regular expression for Linux version formats.

    arguments:
      - name: os_dist
        description: |
          The operating system distribution (e.g., 'Windows 10', 'Ubuntu', 'Sonoma'). This determines which regular expression to use for extracting the build version.
        type: string

      - name: os_version
        description: |
          The full version string of the operating system. This is used in combination with the `os_dist` to extract the specific build version.
        type: string

    returns: string
    examples:
      - input:
          os_dist: 'Windows 10'
          os_version: '10.0.19042.928'
        output: '19042.928'

      - input:
          os_dist: 'Ubuntu'
          os_version: '20.04.2'
        output: '20.04'

      - input:
          os_dist: 'Sonoma'
          os_version: '23.0.1'
        output: '23.0.1'
